# Image Masonry - bearblog-plugin

A very much in development attempt of mine to make myself use bearblog for a photography portfolio by making it easier to mass display images in a nicely spaced grid. 

<hr>

## How does it work? (currently)
I fetch an array of images from a seperate github repository via the api. I then split this array into columns and display everything in a masonry grid.

## Why use bearblog and not litteraly anything else?
Because I can, and I already pay for it.
